==================
The <Epigraph> tag
==================

.. admonition:: <Epigraph>
   
   Purpose
      Defines an optional poem or quotation at the beginning of a chapter. 

   Content
      - `p <p.html>`__

      
The text is entered in the chapter's
"Epigraph"
area in *novelibre*.
It is optional and consists of one or more paragraphs.
Highlighting or other formatting is not supported.
The optional `epigraph's source <epigraphsrc.html>`__ is stored
separately, if any. This makes assigning a special style
easier.
