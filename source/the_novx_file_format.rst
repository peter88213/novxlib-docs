====================
The novx file format
====================

*.novx* files are XML files that can be read and edited with
any text editor that reads and writes utf-8 encoded plain text.

If you put a style sheet named
`novx.css <https://github.com/peter88213/novxlib/tree/main/css>`__
into the current project folder, you can view the *.novx* project file
with a web browser.
Depending on your web browser and your operating system, the
*content type* resp. *MIME type* of *.novx* files must be registered as
*"text/xml"*.

The XML structure and elements of *novx* files are described by the
`novx Document Type Definition <https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre/tree/main/dtd>`__
(DTD).

In addition, descriptions of the elements and their attributes are provided below.
